# CollectionViewSample

This sample contains sample usage of the new CollectionView and CarouselView which will be available in Xamarin.Forms 4.0. At this time, the controls are still in a preview state, and as such are missing features and feature parity.

Feature | Android | iOS
--------|---------|-----
CarouselView | ✔ | ❌
CollectionView | ✔ | ✔
Item Selection| ❌ | ❌

*Note: This only describes general availability of the control/feature; as mentioned, parity may not yet exist for certain behavior. Attempting to use the CarouselView on iOS at this time will cause the app to crash.*
